### User Story for Assignment
A school administrator has to manage a Teacher's Schedule by balancing the number of lecture and the number of classes he/she has to teach in a week .

3.  Students are divided into 3 batches.
4.  A lecture is of 2 hours.
5.  No teacher can have 2 lectures in one day.
6.  The school works for 6 hours a day.
   
### Instructions
*   Create an Optimized solution using the [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) library for the school administrator to manage the teacher's schedule considering all constraints.
*   Document list of assumptions made, which are not covered in the [story](#user-story-for-assignment) but have been used in building the optimiser.
