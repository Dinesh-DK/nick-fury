### Assessment Criteria
1. How simple yet sufficient is the list of questions you will ask a user that helps you create their empathy map. This helps us understand your ability to do research.
2. Screens you choose to build, must exhibit your skills the best from a UI design perspective
3. Prototyping you do, must exhibit your ability to create a clean interaction design.
4. How easy you make it for us to evaluate your submission â€“ afterall, we're talking UX here :-). 
5. Balancing between speed and quality of work - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges. If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them. It is more important for us to know how you can better your own work.
6. Only [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) concepts have been used. This is where we test how you work with good concepts given build constraints that may be at engineering.
